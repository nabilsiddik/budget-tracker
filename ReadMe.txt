Hello sir, 
This is Nabil Siddik. My ID is 21225103403.

My project name is Budget Tracker. Budget Tracker is a Full-Stack Web Application where you can create your daily life budgets and expenses for a specific budget.

Tools and Technologies for my project: 

Front-End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React.js
Backend: Java, Java Spring Boot
Database: MySQL
Rest API: Postman



To run this project, it's need some activities:
1. Open The backend folder to a java IDE
2. Open the fron end folder to vs code or any IDE
3. For Rest API we need to use Postman
4. For database we need to use mysql (xampp/loaclhost)
5. We need to connect the front-end port to the backend

Then the project is ready to properly view and run.
Thank you.
